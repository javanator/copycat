Description

I created this plugin for the bukkit minecraft platform in order to render pixel art style images in-game from URLs. It preprocesses the spritemap for minecraft blocks in order to create a color average per material. In game, once an image URL is entered, it is resized to a specified resolution and dithered. The resize image is processed per-pixel and mapped to corresponding material block. As such, if you are using other texture packs, your results may not be optimal.  


This project should be considered abandoned. See this thread for historical info:
